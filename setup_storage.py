Date: 2024-09-27
Duration: 30 minutes
Participants: 5

John: Good morning everyone. Let's start with our weekly standup. I've been working on the frontend components and I'm about 80% complete with the main dashboard.

Sarah: Hi team. I've finished the backend API development and it's ready for testing. All endpoints are working correctly.

Mike: I've been reviewing the database queries and I think we need to optimize some of them for better performance.

Lisa: I've completed the user authentication module and it's ready for integration.

Tom: I've been working on the documentation and it's up to date with all the recent changes.

John: Great progress everyone. For next week, I'll focus on completing the remaining frontend components.

Sarah: I'll start working on the API testing and documentation.

Mike: I'll work on optimizing the database queries we discussed.

Lisa: I'll help with the frontend integration of the authentication module.

Tom: I'll continue updating the documentation as we make progress.

Meeting concluded at 10:30 AM.
